## Use Cases & Scenarios

### Identify the use cases in this description and draw a use case diagram.

- basic idea is to record the situation in which something happens, explain what should happen, and describe any exceptional circumstances which might arise

Users of the site need to be able to search the treats offers - mostly pumpkins, but also all other kinds of Halloween treats. For Pumpkins, they need to **find information** on the type of Pumpkin, it’s size and weight, and of course it’s price and whether it has been carved already.

Users should be able to **buy a pumpkin online** and have it **delivered** to an address of their choice. They can **pay via various payment methods**, at least money transfer, credit card and a popular online payment service called MoneyPal.
...
Users should also be able to rate the treats and post reviews and fotos. Administrators can edit and delete those reviews as needed.

### Possible Use Cases

- Order Substystem
- Information Substystem
- Payment Substystem
- Rating Substystem
- Administration Substystem (Use Case für Administratoren)
- Backend Subsystem


### Then, pick the most important (or interesting) use case. Write down a detailed scenario for that use case (see below).

#### 1. Use Case: Order Substystem

## Class Diagram

### Then, draw a Class Diagram for your Application. It should contain associations (aggregations and compositions, association classes as needed), generalizations, as well as the most important fields and method names of the classes.
